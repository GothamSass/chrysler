GothamSass is dedicated and committed to providing a harassment-free meetup experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. Sexual and discriminating language and imagery is not appropriate for any meetup venue, including talks.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all meetup venues and meetup-related social events. Sponsor or vendor booths, booth staff and volunteers are also subject to the anti-harassment policy.

Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. Meetup participants violating these rules will be escorted from the meetup without a refund.

We do not tolerate harassment of meetup participants in any form. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of meetup staff immediately. Meetup staff can be identified by special badges.

Meetup staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the meetup.

Contact information for organizers will be provided to ticketed attendees and speakers and available here during the meetup.

This anti-harassment policy is based on the example policy from the Geek Feminism wiki, created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers.
