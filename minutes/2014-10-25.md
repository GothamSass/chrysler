# Meeting Minutes

October 25th, at ThinkCoffee from 1:30 - 3:00 PM

## Summary 

The primary focus of the meeting was to brainstorm and collectively share our ideas for the next phase of Gotham Sass. We spent time thinking about our goals and different ways to meet those goals which included discussions on different types of events we could broaden out from just talks and hacks. We agreed that we wanted to do all work in the open, including finalizing our goals and focus. 

We agreed that we wanted to do a camp, but that our primary focus should be the following: 

* Identity
* Website
    * Manifesto: Community Collaboration
* Settle on speakers for Jan and Feb

*Goals and todos are captured in issue tracker also captured in [milestone]()*

## What do we want the meetup to become

- a platform for growing new speakers
- Paid and free events
  - Funds go to the organization for scholarships
- Transparency with funds
- Providing on ramp for community members into conference speaking, giving workshops, organizing, as well as an introduction to New York City front-end community.
    - Job Board
    - Newsletter
- More focus on beginner to intermediate and helping members advance their skills
- Highlighting who uses sass in nyc community

## Brainstorming ideas for events

- Reach out to community with topics
- Twitter chat
- Regularly welcome meetings for new community members
- More cross pollination with other meetups such as Code Crew
- Specific meetups/focused for a particular area of front-end
- Predetermined problems: work on how to solve/implement 
    - Ex. Use designs from Dribbble
- Code in the Dark
- Panels, round tables, fireside chats
- Set topics and reach out to speaker's specifically 
- Retrospective board
- More front end talks that run the gamut, not just Sass
- Member led workshops and trainings (community and organizations)
- livestream all events
- Twitter bootstrap hack: Take advantage of Sass #perfmatters
