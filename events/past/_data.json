Designing and developing web based user experiences is growing both more challenge and more exciting. CSS, our trusty friend, is inflexible, static, and unwieldy for today's needs. CSS Preprocessors fill the void and open up a whole new arsenal of tools for designers and developers.</p> <p> </p> <p>So whether you are an advanced user, beginner, or <a href=\"http://nathanborror.com/posts/2009/nov/30/sass-isnt-me/\">sceptic</a>, come to the first meetup for NYC Sass/Compass user group. We are planning on keeping this a monthly meeting and will have the next two at New Work City.</p> <p> </p> <p>We have an open format planned for the first meeting. We want to cover what you want, so let us know. We'll review the suggestions and post the format at the end of next week. And while ideally this kickoff should have you convinced why we pick Sass over LESS, we will be happy to have a lightening talk on the subject.</p> <p> </p> <p>Future meetings will eventual evolve to more structured presentation format. If you are using Sass &amp; Compass and want to talk about your work and approach, please reach out to CS.</p> <p>If there's a better day/date to consider for next month's meetup, let us know.</p> <p> </p> <p><b>Speaker list:</b></p> <p>Scott Kellum wrote Sass Modular Scale, contributes to Sassy Math, and is currently working on Singularity. Scott works at Roger Black Studio on Treesaver. Mason Wendell is a Coding Designer. He's the creator behind Survival Kit, a contributor to TheSassWay and runs the Philadelphia Sass Meetup. Mason is Creative Director at Zivtech. Sam Richard is the creator of Aura, A Sass+Compass based Responsive Website framework built with Modular Scale and Susy. He's a contributor to Sassy Math.

"description": "<p>\"Responsive Web Design is hard. Really hard, actually.\" The opening words to <a href=\"http://jeffcroft.com/blog/2012/mar/02/implementing-responsive-design/\">Jeff Croft's insightful post</a> about his development approach with Sass. Yes, responsive is challenging. It is changing the way we think about design; the way we architect our CSS, as we move to from thinking in 960px to thinking about mobile first and designs that will look good at any size; it is changing our perception, workflow, attitude, and swagger. Not since the birth of Web Standards has the web development community received such a resounding shake up. The explosion of CSS Preprocessors couldn't have come at more needed time. We need all the help we can get!</p> <p>In the words of <a href=\"http://john.albin.net/\">John Albin</a>, Front-End Developer extraordinaire and creator of <a href=\"http://zengrids.com/\">Zed Grids</a>, the only way to do responsive web is with a css preprocessor. Sass, especially with its newest release 3.2, outshines the other two CSS Preprocessors when it comes to @media handling. <b>First</b> Sass lets us remove all the junk and rigidity of grid classes from our markup; <b>Second</b>, Sass does all the heavy lifting with is solid math functions–write your own or use one of the many grid extensions available–to spit out those % values down to the 100th value; <b>Third</b> media bubbling keeps stylesheets logical and legible; <b>Fourth</b>, the @content directive and addition of variables in Sass 3.2 blow it all out of the water allowing us to <a href=\"https://github.com/jcroft/jeffcroft-css-framework-v2/blob/master/framework/css/contrib/_media_queries.sass\">create power mixins that \"respond to\" different devices</a>; <b>Fifth,</b> Sass along with new tools, like beloved Live Reload, bring Photoshop to the browser, getting you in the medium faster.</p> <p>For the rest and much more on principles and philosophies of Responsive Web join us Tuesday, June 19th 7PM at New Work City for presentations by Mason Wendell, VP of Creative at Zivtech, and Sam Richard, Front-end Developer at World Economic Forum. This third installment of NYC Sass is not to be missed. Not to worry though, this revolution <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/114681737886881049489/posts\">will be televised</a>.</p> <p><b>The Speakers</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://thecodingdesigner.com/about\">Mason Wendell</a> has been writing, coding, and touting the magic of Sass and Responsive since before we even decided to open our ears to the magic flute of CSS Preprocessor. He's the creator behind <a href=\"https://github.com/canarymason/Survival-Kit\">Survival Kit</a>, coined the term <a href=\"http://thecodingdesigner.com/\">Coding Designer</a>, and author of many articles on RWD in Sass. His work has inspired many, including Jeff Croft who sites Mason's articles as the inspiration for his respond-to gist.</p> <p><a href=\"http://snugug.com/me\">Sam Richard</a> is one of the leading voices on Sass and Responsive as well as frequent collaborator and friend of Mason. He has given talks on RWD at Meetups and Conferences the world over. His recent article, <a href=\"http://snugug.com/musings/principles-responsive-web-design\">Principles of Responsive Web Design</a> is one of the most thorough and expansives look on RWD since <a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/\">Marcotte's seminal text</a>. A must read!</p> <p><b>The Talk</b></p> <p>Mason and Sam will be giving a combined session for the length of the meetup covering the whole Sass+RWD stack with an intermission for a lightning talk on <a href=\"http://susy.oddbird.net/\">Susy</a>, the responsive grid framework for Compass, so strap in and prepare to have your socks blown off.</p> <p><b>Live Streaming</b></p> <p>We will be live streaming this event on the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/sasslive\">Sass Meetups Ustream.tv channel</a></p> <p><b>Good Reads by Mason Wendell</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://thesassway.com/intermediate/responsive-web-design-part-2\">Responsive Web Design in Sass: Using Media Queries in Sass 3.2</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://thesassway.com/intermediate/responsive-web-design-part-2\">Responsive Web Design in Sass Part 2: Media Queries in Sass</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://thesassway.com/intermediate/responsive-web-design-part-1\">Responsive Web Design in Sass Part 1: Fluid Layouts and Fluid Images</a></p>",

"description": "<p>Huzzah! This month we take a look at the cool, shiny things you can do with Sass that would be maddeningly difficult, if not impossible, to do with CSS. We'll hear from three incredibly talented developer-designers–John Refano, Scott Kellum, and Albert Tholen.</p> <p>John Refano (@threehz) will be giving a guided tour of some of the things he has built for Behance, showing how Sass can make your life a lot easier and help out with the creation some cool visual effects. You may even learn more about plain old CSS3 in the process.</p> <p>Scott Kellum (@scottkellum) made <a href=\"https://github.com/scottkellum/modular-scale\">Sassy Modular Scale</a>, a Sass project inspired by and adapted from Tim Brown's <a href=\"http://modularscale.com/\">modularscale.com</a>. Check out <a href=\"http://thesassway.com/projects/modular-scale\">the great article</a> about this project on The Sass Way (<a href=\"http://thesassway.com/projects/modular-scale\"><a href=\"http://thesassway.com/projects/modular-scale\" class=\"linkified\">http://thesassway.com/projects/modular-scale</a></a>) and then come learn from Scott how he built and uses Sassy Modular Scale to bring harmony to his designs and projects.</p> <p>Albert Tholen (@albert_tholen) wrote a Sass script extension to bring the math behind Photoshop's powerful soft-light gradient blending mode to Sass, which eliminates the need for making soft-light gradient backgrounds manually and allows a designer to create beautiful CSS3 gradients in-browser.</p> <p>Our lightening talk dives into Control Directives, a pretty killer Sass feature that sets it apart from the other CSS Preprocessors. Good prep read: <a href=\"http://thesassway.com/intermediate/if-for-each-while\"><a href=\"http://thesassway.com/intermediate/if-for-each-while\" class=\"linkified\">http://thesassway.com/intermediate/if-for-each-while</a></a></p> <p> </p> <p><b>Speakers</b></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/f/f/6/event_142448182.jpeg\" /></p> <p>John Refano (<a href=\"http://www.johnrefano.com/\">johnrefano.com</a> | <a href=\"http://twitter.com/threehz/\">@threehz</a>) is a web developer with a degree in design, residing in Brooklyn, NY.  He is member of the dev team at Behance, and an long time Sass enthusiast.  He loves CSS3 and making things as beautiful as they are functional.</p> <p> </p> <p><img src=\"http://img.pgdn.us/b/profile-5.jpg\" /></p> <p>Scott Kellum (<a href=\"http://www.scottkellum.com\">scottkellum.com</a> | <a href=\"http://twitter.com/scottkellum/\">@scottkellum</a>) is a designer of all trades: graphic, web, typeface, print, publication. He currently works for Vox Media. Scott is behind many Sass extensions from <a href=\"https://github.com/scottkellum/Sassy-math\">Sassy Math</a> to <a href=\"http://singularity.gs/\">Singularity</a>, a responsive grid system designed to be as flexible and small as possible while still providing an enormous amount of power. Scott also resides in Brooklyn, NY.</p> <p> </p> <p><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/c/0/e/event_142627182.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Albert Tholen (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/albert_tholen\">@albert_tholen</a>) is a web development intern for <a href=\"http://getlua.com/\">Lua Technologies, Inc.</a> He studies film and computer science at Wesleyan University. There, he works on web design and development when his schoolwork sees fit to grant him some free time.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><b>Thank you to our Sponsors!</b></p> <p>VOX Media sponsors all the great refreshments. VOX is hiring and you'll get to use Sass in Ruby on Rails environment.</p> <p>New Work City has been providing space for NYC Sass from Day 1.

He is a hybrid web designer, front end developer and is a Sass and Compass enthusiast. He's going to present on Sassy Style Tiles, an open source solution to quickly and easily generating style tiles in CSS and HTML using Sass and Compass. Style Tiles (<a href=\"http://styletil.es/\"><a href=\"http://styletil.es\" class=\"linkified\">http://styletil.es</a></a>) is a great solution for getting away from Photoshop comps. They allow a separation of style from layout. Especially now with responsive web design there's no longer a definitive layout. However, style tiles are still being generated in Photoshop or FireWorks! Sassy Style Tiles lets you design in the browser not in pixel based AdobeLand.</p> <p> </p> <p><a href=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/4/b/4/event_168054452.jpegMason\" class=\"linkified\">http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/4/b/4/event_168054452.jpegMason</a> Wendell is VP of Creative at Zivtech and is going to talk about using Sass for prototyping and designing/developing with a styleguide driven approach.

"description": "<p>Joining us from Chicago GothamSass gives a very special welcome to Shay Howe, Jon Buda and JC Grubbs. The trio are taking a five day road trip across the country spending time with the local community of designers and developers. </p> <p>Their talks deal with constraints. With everything we build we face constraints. We’ll discuss these constraints and how we can best leverage them to our benefit </p> <p><a href=\"http://refreshroadtrip.com/\">http://refreshroadtrip.com/</a>.</p> <p><b>JC Grubbs<br/>Check &amp; Balance<br/></b>In any product construction effort there are many processes: ideation and product definition, design, user testing, software engineering, operations, etc. Healthy product ecosystems employ checks and balances to ensure that good communication and coordination are occurring. In this talk we’ll explore some of the ways these constraints can be applied throughout a team to increase overall effectiveness and happiness.</p> <p><a href=\"http://thegrubbsian.com/\">JC Grubbs</a> is the CEO and Practice Lead at <a href=\"http://www.devmynd.com/\">DevMynd</a>, a software design and development studio in Chicago. JC has spent the last 15 years working in technology professional services and has lead teams from small to large. Over his career he has filled many roles from developer to architect to product owner.</p> <p><br/><img src=\"http://refreshroadtrip.com/assets/img/jc-grubbs.jpg\" /></p> <p><b>Jon Buda,<br/>Design Your Way Out of a Hole Using Constraints</b></p> <p>A blank slate can be an intimidating and overwhelming place to be when designing a new project. Setting constraints and boundaries can help you focus in on the most important aspects of a project, gain important clarity, and allows you to make decisions quicker and easier. Learn a few tricks to setting up your own constraints and how using them can help you push past design roadblocks.</p> <p><br/><a href=\"http://jonbuda.com/\">Jon Buda</a> is web developer who loves to design, or a designer who loves to code – depending on the day. He enjoys solving problems holistically, thinking about back-end, front-end, and design all as equally important parts in crafting great experiences. He helps to organize <a href=\"http://refreshchi.org/\">Refresh Chicago</a>.</p> <p><br/><img src=\"http://refreshroadtrip.com/assets/img/jon-buda.jpg\" /></p> <p><b>Shay Howe<br/>How Constraints Cultivate Growth</b></p> <p>By setting constraints, we force ourselves to be more productive. They help us make decisions, creating focus around the problem we are trying to solve. They improve our consistency, which provides a better experience for our users. And they help us grow, a valuable asset in times of innovation. We’ll discuss constraints and ways we can embrace them.</p> <p>As a designer and front end developer, <a href=\"http://shayhowe.com/\">Shay Howe</a> specializes in product design and interface development, specialties in which he regularly <a href=\"http://learn.shayhowe.com/\">writes and speaks</a> about.

"description": "<p>Remember last year when Jina sent off this tweet heard round the world?</p> <p><br/><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/6/f/0/600_413966352.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Come open the second year of SassConf with a fireside chat with Team Sass Design, a volunteer task force who redesigned the brand and website for Sass, when Chris Eppstein tweeted his frustration with there not being many designers volunteering in the open source community.</p> <p>Team Sass Design was shortlisted for <a href=\"https://thenetawards.com/vote/collaboration/team-sass-design/\">Best Collaborative Project</a> from Net Awards.</p> <p><b>Natalie Weizenbaum,</b> <i>Primary Developer and Architect of Sass</i></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/8/e/6/600_413958662.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>Chris Eppstein</b>, <i>Core Contributor to Sass &amp; Senior Engineer at LinkedIn</i></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/9/4/a/600_413958762.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>Jina Bolton</b>, <i>Team Sass Design Lead &amp; Senior Product Designer at Salesforce UX</i></p> <p><br/><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/b/2/a/600_413959242.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>Bermon Painter</b>, <i>Designer of the new Sass logo </i></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/2/5/a/600_413961082.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Joining them and guiding the conversation will be Hampton Catlin, Creator of Sass and <a href=\"http://campsass.com\">Camp Sass</a>.</p> <p><br/><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/9/2/2/600_413958722.jpeg\" /></p> <p>It's truly a rare moment when the trifecta of Sass—Natalie, Hampton, Chris —are all in one room—let alone every person that contributed to design and make the new face for the community! Last year at SassConf 2013 was the first time in a very long time that we were able to get them all together so we're lucky to have the opportunity to again. A fitting kick-off for SassConf 2014.</p> <p><br/>If you are registered for SassConf, you can check-in early for the conference. Come get your tote and tee. Please RSVP for this event via the Paperless Post invitation. </p> <p>Tonight's opening night event is open to any interested member of GothamSass and their guests. You do not need to have a SassConf ticket to attend but RSVPs are limited for non-ticket holders. </p> <p><br/>Refreshments provided by Meetup.</p> <p><i><b>Opening Night Fireside Chat is generously sponsored by Meetup.com. </b></i></p> <p><br/>Meetup's mission is to revitalize local community and help people around the world self-organize.
